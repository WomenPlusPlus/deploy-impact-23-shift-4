# SHIFT-4

Welcome to the SHIFT-4 repository! This repository is dedicated to our exclusive recruiting platform designed to support underrepresented groups in tech to secure entry-level jobs and internships. Additionally, it aids companies in finding tech talent for their entry-level positions and internships.

## Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch:** The `main` branch contains the production-ready code. This branch should always reflect the latest stable version of the application.

- **Development Branch:** When working on new features or bug fixes, always create a branch from the `development` branch. Use descriptive and meaningful branch names to clarify the purpose of your work.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-23-shift-4.git)
   ```

2. Switch to the `development` branch.
   ```
   git checkout development
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Make your changes and commit them to your branch.
   ```
   git commit -m "Add your commit message here"
   ```

5. Push your branch to the remote repository.
   ```
   git push origin contributor-name/your-feature-name
   ```

6. When your feature or fix is ready, create a pull request from your branch to the `development` branch. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards.

7. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the `development` branch.

8. Periodically, the changes in the `development` branch will be tested, and when deemed stable, they will be merged into the `main` branch for production deployment.
